* Linux: soundcard SDR's may not start on certain systems with an
error "Audio device does not support stereo." A workaround is to use
the pasuspender utility to stop Pulseaudio. If starting the bandmap
from so2sdr, do this

            pasuspender -- so2sdr
   
    or if running so2sdr-bandmap separately,

            pasuspender -- so2sdr-bandmap
