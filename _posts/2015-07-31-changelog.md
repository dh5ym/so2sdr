* Minor changes to enable building under Qt version 5

* Bug fix: under certain conditions, when logging a qso with ctrl-Enter, the
  sent qso number was logged as zero.

## version 2.0.5

* Bug fix: telnet spots were not working

* Add support for PA QSO Party. Some issues however:

        1. the one DX mult for PA stations is not counted
        2. county line operations have to be worked as two separate
		qsos, which will however double-count qso points
		3. portable (/P) and rover (/R) calls are not able to
		change counties. Only mobile /M can change counties.

* Bug fix: geometry of bandmap windows was not being saved when
closing them from within so2sdr.

* Update default config file for CA QSO Party (out of state). Was
missing state in exchange.

## version 2.0.4

* Bug fix: when cancelling CW (for example when switch radios), the
"TX" indicator on the bandmap should be turned off.

* Bug fix for autosend: if CNTRL-R is pressed before the callsign is
 done being sent in Autosend mode, the CW pauses for as long as focus
 is on the other radio, and then starts sending the callsign from the
 begnning if CNTRL-R back to the original radio. (NO3M)

* If already in a S/P QSO, call and exch fields populated, keyboard focus on
 exchange field, but QSY before logging.  QSO is wiped but Sprint space no
 longer works, required hitting ESC to restore. Added extra cleanups to 'qso'
 object, et.al., and set focus to call field when QSYing. (NO3M)

* When QSYing active radio before a QSO was logged, and active radio was
 also the active TX radio (last to transmit),  activeR2CQ was set to false
 but inactive radio callsign field remained "CQCQCQ"/colorized.  Fixed
 activeR2CQ check during QSY to always match inactive radio as QSYing radio
 before clearing R2CQ status. R2CQ radio should always be inactive since
 making that radio active requires [CNTRL/ALT]-R or mouse click focus, which
 all clear R2CQ status. (NO3M)

* add option to scroll to the right in so2sdr-bandmap (NO3M)

* check for a standard contest config file in the user directory
(i.e. ~/.sosdr) when starting a new contest. If this file exists,
it will be used instead of the program default from share/so2sdr (NO3M)

## version 2.0.3

* remove line leftover from testing preventing callsign clearing on radio 2

## version 2.0.2

* fix some bugs related to setting the config file for so2sdr-bandmap,
and choosing the executable for the bandmap in so2sdr.
* hopefully fix some bugs related to S&P mode


## version 2.0.1

* update help files

## version 2.0.0

* add network interface SDRs and Afedri SDR
* some unfinished features removed for the moment (click filter and
  DVK setup)
* rewrite of SDR bandmap; it is now a separate executable and can
  be used with other programs (see Documentation for use with 
  N1MM).
* known problems:
    + control of Afedri SDRs is somewhat buggy for dual-receiver
    models (when using both receivers).

    + under some Linux distributions  so2sdr-bandmap may have trouble 
    accessing the sound card if Pulseaudio is in use. A workaround is to
    use the pasuspender utility to stop Pulseaudio while so2sdr is
    running. If starting the bandmap from so2sdr, do this

            pasuspender -- so2sdr
   
        or if running so2sdr-bandmap separately,

            pasuspender -- so2sdr-bandmap

## version 1.5.2

* fixed several bugs in the alt-D code. Some slight change in how alt-D
  works- now if the radio is changed (alt-R or ctrl-R), and alt-D call
  will be cleared, unless the alt-D qso is already in progress (exchange
  entered).
* fix qso and mult info being shown on wrong radio with alt-D
* Call window has call, ESC pressed; was not clearing the mult and
  worked information, entering S&P mode afterwards would show these for
  the last call even with no entered callsign.
* fixed bandmap TX status bug: changing radios while CW was sending
    would prevent TX icon from turning off. Now turns off TX also whenever
     CW is canceled.


## version 1.5.1

* Some minor bug fixes and code cleanup
* qextserialport code updated
* Build system revised, especially Windows build
