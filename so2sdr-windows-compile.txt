Cross-building so2sdr for Windows under Linux
----------------------------------------------

This uses the cross-build tool mxe  (http://mxe.cc). The default
compiler target for MXE is 32-bit, static linkage. It may be possible
to build shared and 64-bit versions, but I have not tested this.

1. install mxe

git clone https://github.com/mxe/mxe.git


2. Install needed packages for mxe. In mxe directory (in my case /usr/local/src/mxe)

make qt
make portaudio
make fftw
make libltdl
make nsis


3. Set the path to pick up the MXE tools:

export PATH=/usr/local/src/mxe/usr/bin:$PATH



4. build hamlib

note: the hamlib version from sourceforge is old and does not build correctly with mxe!
in mxe directory:

git clone https://github.com/N0NB/hamlib.git

cd hamlib
sh ./autogen.sh
./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32.static --enable-static --disable-shared --prefix=/usr/local/src/mxe/usr/i686-w64-mingw32.static
make
make install



5. some small fixes are needed:

i. in mxe/usr/i686-w64-mingw32.static/lib

ln -s libws2_32.a libWs2_32.a


ii. qextserialport uses a private Qt header (bad practice!). It is missing
from the installed MXE Qt files and has to be added.
In /usr/local/src/mxe/usr/i686-w64-mingw32.static/qt/include/QtCore

mkdir private
cp /usr/include/qt4/QtCore/private/qwineventnotifier_p.h private/.

iii. the current Portaudio does not work correctly with WDMKS when compiled
with Mingw; when run an error box will pop up. It seems ok to just dismiss
this box and not use the WDMKS driver. Alternatively, remove 'wdmks' in the
MXW config script for Portaudio in src/portaudio.mk in the MXE install
directory.


6. build so2sdr

git clone https://github.com/n4ogw/so2sdr.git
cd so2sdr/so2sdr

Note: there are some separate .ui files for Windows. These make
the program fonts more readable:

cp so2sdr.ui.win so2sdr.ui
cp dupesheet.ui.win dupesheet.ui

i686-w64-mingw32.static-qmake-qt4
make

Afterwards so2sdr.exe should be in /release



7. Compress the exe file

With static linkage the exe file is (24 MB). upx can be used to
reduce its size to about 30% of original (UPX version 3.91). If this step is skipped,
NSIS also applies some compression to the executable.

upx --best release/so2sdr.exe


8. Make Windows installer package:

cd ..
i686-w64-mingw32.static/bin/makensis so2sdr-nsis-1.5.1

This is a very basic NSIS installer. To uninstall, run the "uninstall" in the
directory so2sdr is installed into. Nothing in the registry is modified.
